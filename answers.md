Activity 2:
1.  A deck is simply an arraylist that contains card objects.
2.  6
3. The ranks array will be an array of length 13 simply containing all 13 card ranks, starting at ace and ending at two. The suits array will be an array of length 4 containing all 4 suits. The point values will be an array of length 13 containing the numbers 11 to 2, with 10 being repeated 4 times to account for the face cards.
4. The order in suits does not matter, but the orders for ranks and point values have to match each other for the deck constructor.
