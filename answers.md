I played 15 games and won once.

1. 2 possible combinations: 5 of spades with 6 of clubs or 5 of clubs with 6 of clubs
2. These three cards must be J, Q, and K because every card comes in a pair or triplet if it's a face card. This means that to get to this point, every other card must have been removed via its pair so that there are no left over cards. 
3. There is no strategy involved in this game; because every card pairs up with a card of only 1 other rank with no overlap, choosing one play does not mean that you forgo the other one. Both plays will be made with the same end result, so it does not matter what you choose.
