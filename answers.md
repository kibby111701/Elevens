1. The games are similar in that they still use the same cards as far as ranks and suits, but not point values. The deck will still be shuffled and dealt from in the same way. The main differences come in how large the board is (size = 13, 11, or 10), and how to remove cards from the board (pairs adding up to 10 or quartets of 10s or face cards/pairs adding up to 11 or triplets of JQK/pairs adding up to 13 or single kings), which extends to determining if a move is legal or if there is another play possible.
2. The Board constructor contains all of the code for actually creating the board by asking for the size of the board, the suits, the ranks, and the point values. It then sets up its instance variables from there. The ElevensBoard class contains final ints and strings for the point values, ranks, suits, and board size. Then, the ElevensBoard constructor just uses the Super command with the final data inside to construct the Board class with that data.
3. The abstract methods are isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible. The way they are implemented in ElevensBoard does cover all of the differences because they override the empty abstract methods in Board, but it will only be used if the user plays Elevens. This way, the ElevensBoard class can implement these methods according to the rules of Elevens without them carrying over to Tens or Thirteens.
